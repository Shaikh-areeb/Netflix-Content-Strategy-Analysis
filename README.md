# Conclusion 

So, the content strategy of Netflix revolves around maximizing viewership through targeted release timing and content variety. 
Shows consistently outperform movies in viewership, with significant spikes in December and June, indicating strategic releases around these periods. 
The Fall season stands out as the peak time for audience engagement. Most content is released on Fridays, 
which aims to capture viewers right before the weekend, and viewership aligns strongly with this release pattern. 
While the number of releases is steady throughout the year, viewership varies, which suggests a focus on high-impact titles and optimal release timing over sheer volume.
